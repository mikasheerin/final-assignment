Week 1

Picked my ten songs and samples, downloaded them, cut them to be 30 seconds, and also figured out the percentage of the sample within the song by looking at how many seconds the sample appears within the entire song. I then found album covers for the songs, and resized them. I then began to implement the bootstrap theme, but some items such as the radio buttons don't look the same as the theme and that will be something I need to figure out in Week 3. I then used HighCharts to represent the percentages mentioned above, I had some issues with the presentation of the charts but figured it out playing around in JSFiddle. I'm pleased that everything is now laid out for the rest of my project (except the wrong answer titles which I want to give more thought to in order to be tricky), and I actually learned a lot already in one week about these songs and the samples they use. I was a little disappointed that there weren't more varying percentages, but I think it still serves the same shock value of not realizing that a sample can pretty much carry a whole song. Overall I think the amount of time I spent working on the backbone of this project is important and will help make my other weeks go smoothly.
