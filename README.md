Week 1

Picked my ten songs and samples, downloaded them, cut them to be 30 seconds, and also figured out the percentage of the sample within the song by looking at how many seconds the sample appears within the entire song. I then found album covers for the songs, and resized them. I then began to implement the bootstrap theme, but some items such as the radio buttons don't look the same as the theme and that will be something I need to figure out in Week 3. I then used HighCharts to represent the percentages mentioned above, I had some issues with the presentation of the charts but figured it out playing around in JSFiddle. I'm pleased that everything is now laid out for the rest of my project (except the wrong answer titles which I want to give more thought to in order to be tricky), and I actually learned a lot already in one week about these songs and the samples they use. I was a little disappointed that there weren't more varying percentages, but I think it still serves the same shock value of not realizing that a sample can pretty much carry a whole song. Overall I think the amount of time I spent working on the backbone of this project is important and will help make my other weeks go smoothly.

Week 2

This week I had to rearrange some of the html in order to make the javascript easier for my task this week. I thought it would be simple to switch the two divs of my song/album art and sample/highchart, but it turned out that I could not make it work for whatever reason. I tried simple on click functions and show hide functions as well as a switch statement with these. Although I successfully hid the highchart/sample, I could not switch it with the song/album cover.

Week 3

This week I made everything work functionally, from hiding/showing the songs and their samples, to making the app show one question at a time. I did this all through hide/show functions on buttons. I also played with the css and bootstrap to get the form to look to my liking and made sure it was responsive on mobile (which bootstrap makes it easy to do). I'm mostly pleased with my project as of now, except for the colors. I think they are too bright but I was matching the colors of the theme. I only had an issue with one of the charts for the sample "We Will Rock You" by Queen and cannot figure why that HighChart won't load like the rest, as I didn't change anything.
